e Machine Learning: Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit Learn, OpenCV, Natural Language Processing
e Interpersonal: Team Management, Leadership, Public Soeaking, Teamwork

Content Writer, Exa Mobility (July 2020 - October 2020)
e Spearheaded the research and development of website content along with senior team members,
boosting the website traffic by ~15%.
e Headed, enhanced, and overhauled all content aspects for Exa’s mobile application.

Content Writer, Shinobi Brands (June 2019 - Aug 2019)
e Proactively identified and resolved gaps in the content development support structure and improved
workflow processes.
e Operated with strategic planners, business owners, and other creative team members to conceptualize,
devise and produce brand stories.

Vishwakarma Institue of Information & Technology, Pune, India (June 2018 to Present)
Bachelor of Technology (BTech) in Electronics & Telecommunication
C.G.P.A. - 9.40

Coursework

e Mathematics - Multivariable & Vector Calculus, Differential Equations, Probability & Random Processes

e Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms, Design and Analysis of Algorithms

e Electrical Engineering - Signals & Systems, Digital Signal Processing, Information Theory, Control Systems, loT

Sales Predictor (Time Series Analysis/ ARIMA/LSTM)
e A Tensorflow implementation undertaken to predict future sales using historic data of ten stores.
e Used three various models: Linear Regressor, ARIMA, and RNN for prediction and compared their
performances using MAE and RMSE metrics.

Melody Generator (Python/Scipy)
e Built a virtual piano with its very own octave, using the base frequency of a single note.
e Synthesized 4 to 5 tunes using the octave of the virtual piano and python's SciPy and NumPy libraries.
